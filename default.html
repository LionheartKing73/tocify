          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Venous Leg Ulcers (VLUs) are a relatively common, complex type of wound that have a negative impact on people’s lives and incur high costs for health services&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=612" class="reference" title="Protease-modulating matrix treatments for healing venous leg ulcers. | Westby, Maggie J et al. | 2017">[8]</a>. VLU can be defined as an open skin lesion of the leg or foot that occurs in an area affected by venous hypertension&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=619" class="reference" title="Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery ® and the American Venous Forum. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[5]</a>. VLUs can result in pain, unpleasant odor, reduced mobility, sleep disturbance, reduced psychological well-being and social isolation&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=612" class="reference" title="Protease-modulating matrix treatments for healing venous leg ulcers. | Westby, Maggie J et al. | 2017">[8]</a>. In severe cases and when associated with arterial insufficiency, VLUs can lead to limb amputation&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1225" class="reference" title="Chronic venous insufficiency and venous leg ulceration. | Valencia, I C et al. | 2017">[10]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=1288" class="reference" title="VenUS II: a randomised controlled trial of larval therapy in the management of leg ulcers. | Dumville, J C et al. | 2017">[11]</a></p>
          <p>Venous ulcers are often recurrent, and open ulcers can persist from weeks to many years. It is estimated that 93% of VLUs will heal in 12 months, and 7% remain unhealed after five years. The recurrence rate within 3 months after wound closure is as high as 70%.&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=427" class="reference" title="Management of patients with venous leg ulcers: challenges and current best practice. | Franks, Peter J et al. | 2017">[1]</a>. Thirty-five percent of people with VLU experience four or more episodes&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1286" class="reference" title="Arterial disease in chronic leg ulceration: an underestimated hazard? Lothian and Forth Valley leg ulcer study. | Callam, M J et al. | 2017">[2]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=1287" class="reference" title="Venous and non-venous leg ulcers: clinical history and appearance in a population study. | Nelzén, O et al. | 2017">[3]</a></p>
          <p>The first-line treatment for VLUs is compression therapy, but 32%-45% of people have unhealed ulcers after 24 weeks of treatment with adequate compression&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=612" class="reference" title="Protease-modulating matrix treatments for healing venous leg ulcers. | Westby, Maggie J et al. | 2017">[8]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=1239" class="reference" title="Economic analysis of VenUS I, a randomized trial of two bandages for treating venous leg ulcers. | Iglesias, C P et al. | 2017">[12]</a>. Since these figures were extracted from randomized controlled trials, the percentage of unhealed ulcers in the real world are probably higher.</p>

          <p>Despite the relatively low prevalence, VLUs represent a significant financial burden to the healthcare system in the U.S., estimated to be between US$ 2 and 2.5 billion per year&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=619" class="reference" title="Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery ® and the American Venous Forum. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[5]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=458" class="reference" title="Diagnosis and Treatment of Venous Ulcers - American Family Physician |  | 2017">[13]</a>. One study estimated the overall burden to Medicare and private insurers due to VLU in the U.S. (excluding out-of-pocket payments and other indirect costs such as lost productivity) to be of US$14.9 billion (in 2012 US$ ).&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1265" class="reference" title="Burden of venous leg ulcers in the United States. | Rice, J Bradford et al. | 2017">[14]</a> In the U.K., estimated costs to treat a person with open leg ulcer is around GBP 1700 (US$ 2122) per year at 2012 prices, mostly related to nursing time&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=522" class="reference" title="Clinical and cost-effectiveness of compression hosiery versus compression bandages in treatment of venous leg ulcers (Venous leg Ulcer Study IV, VenUS IV): a randomised controlled trial. | Ashby, Rebecca L et al. | 2017">[15]</a>. &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Etiology</h3>
          <p>Venous ulcers are the final stage of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI)&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=612" class="reference" title="Protease-modulating matrix treatments for healing venous leg ulcers. | Westby, Maggie J et al. | 2017">[8]</a>. It is not infrequent for leg ulcers to be associated with CVI and arterial vascular disease, in which case, these ulcers are said to be of “mixed etiology.” The term chronic venous disease is generally applied to the full spectrum of chronic venous disease (CEAP C0-6), whereas chronic venous insufficiency is reserved for more severe presentations (CEAP C4-6) <a href="/app/reference?id=1285" class="reference" title="Chronic venous disease. | Bergan, John J et al. | 2017">[16]</a>.</p>

          <h3>Risk Factors &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
          <ul>
            <ul></ul>
            <li>Risk factors for CVI: older age, obesity, previous leg injuries, deep venous thrombosis, and phlebitis&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=458" class="reference" title="Diagnosis and Treatment of Venous Ulcers - American Family Physician |  | 2017">[13]</a>&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=655" class="reference" title="Overview of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of venous leg ulcers: a US perspective. | White-Chu, E Foy et al. | 2017">[17]</a></li>
            <li>Risk factors for delayed VLU healing or recurrence: Initial wound area and VLU duration (a VLU that is smaller than 10cm2 and has a duration shorter than 12 months at first visit has a 70% change of healing by the 24th week of care, whereas a VLU larger than 10cm2 and with a duration longer than 12 months has only 22% chance of healing by the 24th week of care&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=612" class="reference" title="Protease-modulating matrix treatments for healing venous leg ulcers. | Westby, Maggie J et al. | 2017">[8]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=579" class="reference" title="The accuracy of venous leg ulcer prognostic models in a wound care system. | Margolis, David J et al. | 2017">[18]</a>. Other risk factors include post thrombotic syndrome or venous insufficiency in superficial and/or deep vein systems and/or the perforating venous systems, history of vascular surgery, trauma, repeat intimal venous damage or varicosities, family history of VLU, male gender, obesity, increasing age &gt; 50 years of age <a href="/app/reference?id=494" class="reference" title="Association for the Advancement of Wound Care (AAWC) Venous Ulcer Guideline. | Associaton for the Advancement of Wound Care, et al. | 2016">[19]</a>.</li>
          </ul><ul>
            <ul></ul>
          </ul>

          <ul></ul>


          <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>CVI results in venous hypertension (ambulatory venous pressures of up to 60 to 90 mmHg, as opposed to the normal levels of 20 to 30 mmHg), which can happen due to obstruction to venous flow, dysfunction of venous valves, and/or failure of the "venous pump." Venous hypertension and hemodynamic abnormalities lead to inflammatory alterations with microcirculatory changes that can result in venous stasis and VLU.&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1302" class="reference" title="Venous leg ulceration pathophysiology and evidence based treatment. | Chi, Yung-Wei et al. | 2017">[20]</a></li>
            <li>The pathophysiology of VLU is complex and healing is delayed in many patients due to a chronic inflammatory condition.&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1226" class="reference" title="Pathophysiology of wound healing and alterations in venous leg ulcers-review. | Raffetto, Joseph D et al. | 2017">[21]</a> Patient risk factors predispose individuals to chronic&nbsp;venous&nbsp;diseases including VLU. Changes in shear stress to the vein walls are likely initiating events, leading to activation of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, and leukocyte activation with attachment and migration into vein wall, microcirculation, and in the interstitial space. Multiple chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, proteases and matrix metalloproteinases are produced. The pathology of VLU involves an imbalance of inflammation, inflammatory modulators, oxidative stress, and proteinase activity&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1226" class="reference" title="Pathophysiology of wound healing and alterations in venous leg ulcers-review. | Raffetto, Joseph D et al. | 2017">[21]</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Epidemiology</h3>

          <h4>Prevalence</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Prevalence of ulcers of venous etiology only the UK is about 2.9 cases per 10,000 people <a href="/app/reference?id=612" class="reference" title="Protease-modulating matrix treatments for healing venous leg ulcers. | Westby, Maggie J et al. | 2017">[8]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=915" class="reference" title="Age-specific search strategies for Medline. | Kastner, Monika et al. | 2017">[22]</a>, whereas mixed arterial/venous leg ulcers have a prevalence of 1.1 per 10,000 people&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=619" class="reference" title="Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery ® and the American Venous Forum. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[5]</a>.</li>
            <li>Approximately 1% of the population in the United States, 3% of people over 80 years of age in westernized countries&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=427" class="reference" title="Management of patients with venous leg ulcers: challenges and current best practice. | Franks, Peter J et al. | 2017">[1]</a>. Prevalence is increasing, coinciding with an ageing population. In the U.S., VLUs affect between 500,000 to 2 million people per year <a href="/app/reference?id=828" class="reference" title="Chronic Venous Ulcers: A Comparative Effectiveness Review of Treatment Modalities | AHRQ, et al. | 2017">[9]</a>.</li>
            <li>More prevalent among women, but this gender discrepancy decreases with age&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=655" class="reference" title="Overview of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of venous leg ulcers: a US perspective. | White-Chu, E Foy et al. | 2017">[17]</a>.</li>
            <li>Most common type of leg ulcer (~ 80% of &nbsp;leg ulcers)&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=458" class="reference" title="Diagnosis and Treatment of Venous Ulcers - American Family Physician |  | 2017">[13]</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Incidence &nbsp;</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The overall incidence rate is 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71, 0.83) for men and 1.42 (1.35, 1.48) per 100 person-years for women. <a href="/app/reference?id=1579" class="reference" title="Venous leg ulcer: Incidence and prevalence in the elderly | Margolis DJ, Bilker W, Santanna J, Baumgarten M et al. | 2002">[23]</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Assessment</h2>
          <span id="history" class="bookmark" title="#history"> <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i></span>
          <h3>History</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Qualified professional multidisciplinary team should evaluate and perform a complete assessment of the patient. Patients with VLU frequently present with other co-morbidities.</li>
            <li>It is important to obtain a comprehensive patient history of the patient’s current condition, recurrence and treatment if any, medical and surgical history including past deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism or malignancy, medications, and other risk factors related to VLU, CVI or non-healing leg wounds&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=619" class="reference" title="Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery ® and the American Venous Forum. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[5]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=494" class="reference" title="Association for the Advancement of Wound Care (AAWC) Venous Ulcer Guideline. | Associaton for the Advancement of Wound Care, et al. | 2016">[19]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=1425" class="reference" title="Algorithm-based approach to management of venous leg ulceration. | Verma, Himanshu et al. | 2017">[24]</a>.</li>
            <li>Symptoms potentially related to chronic venous disease should be identified. Those include: extremity pain, burning aching, throbbing, cramps, heaviness, itching, tiredness, fatigue, and restless legs&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=619" class="reference" title="Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery ® and the American Venous Forum. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[5]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=458" class="reference" title="Diagnosis and Treatment of Venous Ulcers - American Family Physician |  | 2017">[13]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=494" class="reference" title="Association for the Advancement of Wound Care (AAWC) Venous Ulcer Guideline. | Associaton for the Advancement of Wound Care, et al. | 2016">[19]</a>. Venous symptoms are usually exacerbated when the patient is standing and relieved by rest or limb elevation (as opposed to pain of peripheral artery disease, which worsens with walking or that is relieved by rest, or which worsens with limb elevation). Pain is localized to the affected veins, skin changes or ulcer and does not irradiate.</li>

              <li>Rationale: Plethysmography can identify hemodynamic obstruction patterns Blecken.

The cut-off values of toe pressure and TBI are arbitrary and vary in the literature. In general, a toe pressure of 70 to 110 mmHg or TBI &gt; 0.5 to 0.75 is considered normal and anything below is diagnostic of PAD. A toe pressure lower than 30 mmHg or TBI&nbsp;0.2 is considered severely ischemic and diagnostic of critical limb ischemia (CLI).

              <li>Rationale: As for choice of primary topical dressing, current evidence (level of evidence C) suggests that when used with adequate compression in patients with venous ulcer, different types of primary dressings are equally effective as long as they are used beneath adequate compression.

Also, many antimicrobial impregnated dressings have similar HCPCS codes as their non-antimicrobial impregnated counterparts, even though they are more costly to manufacture. As a result, if an antimicrobial impregnated dressing is ordered for a Medicare part B covered patient, the DME supplier might substitute it for another lower cost product with similar HCPCS&nbsp; <a href="/app/reference?id=165" class="reference" title="Dressed for Success: What Clinicians Need to Know about Ordering Wound Dressings | Today's Wound Clinic | Fife, C et al. | 2017">[60]</a>. When paid out-of-pocket, antimicrobial impregnated dressings are more expensive than their non-antimicrobial impregnated counterparts. If however, patients show signs of VLU infection, topic and systemic antibiotic therapy should also be initiated (<a href="#Edema-control-with-adequate">See Systemic antibiotics</a>).</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Rationale: Skin maceration is primarily caused by excess exudate, which can enlarge the wound and impede healing <a href="/app/reference?id=1548" class="reference" title="Wound Healing Society 2015 update on guidelines for venous ulcers. | Marston, William et al. | 2017">[28]</a>. &nbsp;The mainstay of treatment and prevention of skin maceration is management of excess exudate (<a href="#Exudate-management-back">See “Exudate management</a>”).

            <ul>
              <li>Rationale: Patients with VLU often have stasis dermatitis (stasis eczema), which manifests as dry, itchy skin, erythema, hemosiderin deposition, and scaling <a href="/app/reference?id=145" class="reference" title="Stasis dermatitis: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management. | Sundaresan, Swaminathan et al. | 2017">[67]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=318" class="reference" title="Chronic pruritus in the elderly: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. | Valdes-Rodriguez, Rodrigo et al. | 2017">[68]</a>. If left untreated, symptomatic stasis dermatitis can lead to scratching and fissuring, which can delay VLU healing and contribute towards development of new ulcers. Stasis dermatitis is a result of venous hypertension&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=315" class="reference" title="Evidence that venous hypertension causes stasis dermatitis. | Sippel, K et al. | 2017">[69]</a>&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=156" class="reference" title="Edema: Diagnosis and Management - American Family Physician | Trayes, K et al. | 2017">[70]</a>&nbsp;and thus, compression is considered the main treatment for stasis dermatitis. Topical local treatment is also essential and consists mainly of emollients and steroids. There is high-quality evidence that supports use of moisturizers on eczematous skin to improve symptoms, and decrease the amount of topical corticosteroids needed to achieve similar reductions in eczema severity&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=494" class="reference" title="Association for the Advancement of Wound Care (AAWC) Venous Ulcer Guideline. | Associaton for the Advancement of Wound Care, et al. | 2016">[19]</a>  <a href="/app/reference?id=415" class="reference" title="Emollients and moisturisers for eczema. | van Zuuren, Esther J et al. | 2017">[71]</a>.

          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Rationale: The latter two conditions should be properly treated before compression therapy is initiated. Cellulitis is a relative contraindication – compression may be used, as long as antibiotic therapy has been implemented. All VLU patients should be screened for arterial disease using Doppler measurement of the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) by trained staff before receiving compression therapy <a href="/app/reference?id=617" class="reference" title="Compression for venous leg ulcers. | O'Meara, Susan et al. | 2017">[7]</a>.

However, Of note, staff familiarity with different types of compression systems can greatly influence compression effectiveness.

As for costs, multilayered compression systems with elastic components are generally more expensive than single-layered ones when considering product costs only. However, clinicians need to consider not only material costs, but also other types of costs, such as nursing time and frequency of change, and effectiveness. In terms of cost-effectiveness, multilayered compression systems with elastic components are more cost-effective than usual care&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1201" class="reference" title="Randomized clinical trial and economic analysis of four-layer compression bandaging for venous ulcers. | O'Brien, J F et al. | 2017">[86]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=1238" class="reference" title="Prospective Comparison of Healing Rates and Therapy Costs for Conventional and Four-Layer High-Compression Bandaging Treatments of Venous Leg Ulcers | Taylor, A.

              <li>Rationale: IPC uses an air pump to inflate and deflate an airtight bag wrapped around the leg, and it is considered better than no compression in promoting VU healing, but currently there is little evidence to support that addition of IPC to compression therapy offers any benefit <a href="/app/reference?id=1580" class="reference" title="Clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Venous Forum (AVF)--Management of venous leg ulcers. | O’Donnell TF Jr PM. et al. | 2014">[79]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=618" class="reference" title="Intermittent pneumatic compression for treating venous leg ulcers. | Nelson, E Andrea et al. | 2017">[91]</a>.

              <li>Rationale: VLU treatments generally do not eliminate the underlying venous hypertension that caused VLU in the first place, so a degree of compression seems to be necessary long term <a href="/app/reference?id=1548" class="reference" title="Wound Healing Society 2015 update on guidelines for venous ulcers. | Marston, William et al. | 2017">[28]</a>.

As such, one cannot determine with certainty that compression therapy is effective in reducing risk of recurrence, but one cannot refute this possibility either. As for level of compression, results from one&nbsp;trial&nbsp;suggest that recurrence is lower in high-compression hosiery than in medium-compression hosiery <a href="/app/reference?id=1427" class="reference" title="Compression for preventing recurrence of venous ulcers. | Nelson, E Andrea et al. | 2017">[93]</a>.

Another complicating factor is the fact that Medicare part B and most insurance plans do not cover compression therapy (including gradient compression stockings) for prevention of VLU once it has healed, which can also impact on patient adherence if financial resources are an issue.

It is important to note that wound coverage will not address the underlying cause of VLU, and thus continued use of compression therapy is essential <a href="/app/reference?id=1548" class="reference" title="Wound Healing Society 2015 update on guidelines for venous ulcers. | Marston, William et al. | 2017">[28]</a>.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prior to any wound coverage procedure, clinical guidelines recommend that the wound bed be prepared adequately, by removing slough, debris, necrotic tissue and management of bioburden levels, preferably to 10^5 CFU/g of tissue, with no beta hemolytic streptococci in the venous ulcer (5,28)</li>

            <ul><li><u>Rationale</u>: Although available literature cannot provide firm evidence of benefit in VLU healing <a href="/app/reference?id=1548" class="reference" title="Wound Healing Society 2015 update on guidelines for venous ulcers. | Marston, William et al. | 2017">[28]</a><a href="/app/reference?id=851" class="reference" title="AAWC Venous Ulcer Guideline | AAWC, et al. | 2017">[94]</a><a href="/app/reference?id=1431" class="reference" title="Skin grafting for venous leg ulcers. | Jones, June E et al. | 2017">[115]</a>, most surgeons have experience with this procedure, and it might be most accessible than other types of wound coverage alternatives. This procedure is generally done at a surgical facility, and requires some sort of anesthesia, exposing patients to inherent risks. Another disadvantage is the need to create other wounds (donor areas, which increase recovery time, and create cosmetic concerns).</li></ul>
            <li><b>Free flaps</b>: For patients with recalcitrant VLU with severe lipodermatosclerosis, the Wound Healing Society guideline suggests free flap transfer <a href="/app/reference?id=1548" class="reference" title="Wound Healing Society 2015 update on guidelines for venous ulcers. | Marston, William et al. | 2017">[28]</a>.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Rationale</u>: Wide excision of diseased tissue and replacement with uninjured tissue and venous valves can help in the treatment of VLU. Microsurgical flaps are performed by specialists, require hospitalization and specialized healthcare staff.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Pedicled and perforator flaps</b>: For patients with recalcitrant VLU with severe lipodermatosclerosis, when resources needed for free flaps are not available, clinicians might opt to cover VLU with pedicled or perforator flaps<a href="/app/reference?id=1279" class="reference" title="Wound coverage considerations for defects of the lower third of the leg. | Bajantri, Babu et al. | 2017">[116]</a>.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Rationale</u>: Free flaps are still preferred as they avoid additional scarring in surrounding area, commonly seen when local flaps are used and primary closure is not possible due to excessive tension and tissue that is not affected by chronic venous insufficiency is brought to replace injured areas. Pedicled flaps, such as reverse sural flap sacrifice major vascular supply to the foot.

            <ul>
              <li>Rationale: NPWT collects excessive wound exudate and is thought to reduce the frequency of dressing changes and to promote healing by drawing together of wound edges, increasing perfusion, and removing infectious material and exudate <a href="/app/reference?id=1424" class="reference" title="Negative pressure wound therapy for treating leg ulcers. | Dumville, Jo C et al. | 2017">[147]</a>.

There is low quality evidence that NPWT (compared with no NPWT) can help healing of VLU if used prior to and right after skin grafting Medicare will cover NPWT for treatment of VLU if compression therapy and other types of standard care fail. Some adverse effects include wound maceration, retention of dressings, wound infection and other injuries.

                    <li>The 2006 Wound Healing Society guideline, updated in 2015, suggested that wounds be cleansed with a neutral, nonirritating, nontoxic solution such as sterile saline or water initially and at each dressing change, and that routine wound cleansing be accomplished with a minimum of chemical and/or mechanical trauma. Their suggestion was based on low-quality evidence (<font color="#ff0000">Evidence level C</font>) from on 1 literature review, 1 clinical case series, and 2 experimental studies, and based on principles that irrigating and cleansing the wound removes loose impediments to wound healing <a href="/app/reference?id=1548" class="reference" title="Wound Healing Society 2015 update on guidelines for venous ulcers. | Marston, William et al. | 2017">[28]</a><a href="/app/reference?id=620" class="reference" title="Guidelines for the treatment of venous ulcers. | Robson, Martin C et al. | 2017">[34]</a></li>
                    <li>The 2014 American Society for Vascular Surgery guideline suggested that venous leg ulcers be cleansed initially and at each dressing change with a neutral, nonirritating, nontoxic solution, performed with a minimum of chemical or mechanical trauma (Grade 2C). Their suggestion was based on low-quality evidence (<font color="#ff0000">Evidence level C</font>), from on 1 literature review, 1 RCT with high risk of bias and imprecision, and 1 clinical case series, and assuming that most patients with VUs present with significant wound exudate and other debris in and around the wound area that must be cleansed routinely before dressing application. <a href="/app/reference?id=619" class="reference" title="Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery ® and the American Venous Forum. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[5]</a></li>
                    <li>The 2010 AAWC guideline recommends that VU be cleansed gently at low pressure (4-15psi) with safe, non-antimicrobial cleanser, based on 1 RCT at high risk of bias/imprecision, 1 literature review, and 1 study that validated the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of multidisciplinary guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of venous leg ulcer, and was not specific to cleansers in wound care. Although authors classified evidence as high-quality (<font color="#397b21">evidence level A</font>), according to the GRADE methodology, we would classify evidence as low-quality (evidence level C) due to high risk of bias/ imprecision. <a href="/app/reference?id=494" class="reference" title="Association for the Advancement of Wound Care (AAWC) Venous Ulcer Guideline. | Associaton for the Advancement of Wound Care, et al. | 2016">[19]</a></li>

                    <li>A 2011 analysis of 14 guidelines for VLU found that debridement was suggested in 86% of the guidelines, but only one-third suggested at the strong level <a href="/app/reference?id=941" class="reference" title="The need for an Intersociety Consensus Guideline for venous ulcer. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[39]</a>.</li>
                    <li>A 2015 Cochrane systematic review that evaluated 10 RCT (715 participants) recognized that there is consensus in the wound care literature that debridement is necessary to promote wound healing <a href="/app/reference?id=639" class="reference" title="Wound bed preparation: a systematic approach to wound management. | Schultz, Gregory S et al. | 2017">[37]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=180" class="reference" title="An updated overview and clarification of the principle role of debridement. | Strohal, R et al. | 2017">[38]</a> <a href="/app/reference?id=941" class="reference" title="The need for an Intersociety Consensus Guideline for venous ulcer. | O'Donnell, Thomas F et al. | 2017">[39]</a>, however authors found only minimal evidence to support active debridement of VLU to promote wound healing. Most studies had unclear risk of bias or were at high risk of bias. The smallness of the evidence base means that one cannot conclude with confidence that debridement improves healing, or which method of debridement, or duration of debridement confers most benefit in the healing of venous ulcers. RCTs that met inclusion criteria in this review evaluated only autolytic and enzymatic debridement methods, and none of the included RCTs evaluated surgical, sharp or mechanical methods of debridement, or debridement versus no debridement <a href="/app/reference?id=614" class="reference" title="Debridement for venous leg ulcers. | Gethin, Georgina et al. | 2017">[40]</a>.</li>

                    <li>A 2015 Cochrane systematic review that evaluated 5 RCTs (295 participants). All studies were industry funded. 1 compared different brands of alginate, 3 compared alginate with hydrocolloid, 1 with plain non-adherent dressing. Most participants received the dressing and four-layer bandage. No statistically significant between-group differences were detected for any comparison, for any healing outcome. Meta-analysis was feasible for one comparison (alginate and hydrocolloid dressings) with data from two RCTs (84 participants) pooled for complete healing at six weeks: risk ratio 0.42 (95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.21). Adverse event profiles were generally similar between groups (not assessed for alginate versus plain non-adherent dressings. Authors concluded that the current evidence base is of low quality, mainly due to mostly uncertain risk of bias. Evidence does not suggest that alginate dressings are more or less effective in the healing of venous leg ulcers than hydrocolloid or plain non-adherent dressings, and there is no evidence to indicate a difference between different proprietary alginate dressings. It is possible that dressing performance, in terms of ease of removal, is better for hydrocolloid dressings than alginate.&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=611" class="reference" title="Alginate dressings for venous leg ulcers. | O'Meara, Susan et al. | 2017">[153]</a></li>

                    <li>A 2014 Cochrane systematic review that evaluated 5 RCTs (233 participants) that reported 8 comparisons of systemic antibiotics (co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, amoxicillin and levamisole) versus placebo, usual care or another antibiotic. In 1 RCT, more participants healed on levamisole compared to placebo (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.62). However, the trial had an unclear risk of bias - did not state whether VU were infected or not at baseline, and had a small sample size – results could have happened by chance (evidence level C). Levamisole is unlicensed in the UK, and is only available from ’special order’ suppliers for use in treating roundworm infection, and it was withdrawn from the US market in 1999. Authors of the review concluded that at present, no evidence is available to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics in promoting healing of clinically infected venous leg ulcers. However, the studies had an unclear risk of bias with potential limitations that can affect the results of the studies and sample size was small (evidence level C). Therefore, authors could not recommend the discontinuation of any of the agents reviewed. In light of the increasing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, current prescribing guidelines recommend that antibacterial preparations should be used only in cases of clinical infection, not for bacterial colonization <a href="/app/reference?id=636" class="reference" title="Antibiotics and antiseptics for venous leg ulcers. | O'Meara, Susan et al. | 2017">[58]</a>.</li>

                    <li>According to the 2012 Cochrane systematic review on the topic, there is evidence that multi-component compression systems are more effective than single-component systems. Most trials that evaluated this comparison were small and at unclear or high risk of bias and did not find a statistically significant difference in outcome, but one was large and at unclear risk of bias, and found that multi-component system was more effective than single-component <a href="/app/reference?id=617" class="reference" title="Compression for venous leg ulcers. | O'Meara, Susan et al. | 2017">[7]</a>. Authors of the review believe that overall potential limitations of the large study are somewhat likely to lower confidence in the estimate of effect mainly due to lack of blinding of outcome assessment (evidence level B). The review also concluded that multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear to be more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents, based on 5RCTs pooled data. 4 RCTs were small and at high or unclear risk of bias due to non-blinded outcome assessment, however 1 RCT was large and at low risk of bias. The pooled data of individual patient data or IPD (which allows a more sensitive analysis compared to aggregate data) showed at a statistically significant level that multi-component systems (4 layers bandages, or 4LB) with elastic bandage are more effective than multi-component systems that include an inelastic bandage (short stretch bandage, or SSB). However, authors recognize that staff familiarity with certain compression systems can greatly influence their effectiveness. The difference between 4LB and short-stretch bandages (SSB) in the IPD meta-analysis could be partly explained by skill and experience of bandagers; 3 out of 5 trials (75% of participants) were conducted in the UK, where 4LB is standard &nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=617" class="reference" title="Compression for venous leg ulcers. | O'Meara, Susan et al. | 2017">[7]</a>.</li>

It is important to note that the categories of compression compared by this study are different than the ones in the Cochrane review <a href="/app/reference?id=617" class="reference" title="Compression for venous leg ulcers. | O'Meara, Susan et al. | 2017">[7]</a> and thus the group of trials representing each comparison differed as well. For instance, even though trials comparing SSB and 4LB are included in the assessment of SSB vs. LSB, the overall result of the meta-analysis is different because other studies that compare other types of LSB and SSB are included in the group of trials. Also, this study included 2 more recent trials that did not identify difference in VLU healing between 4LB and SSB. One of these trials&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1581" class="reference" title="The Canadian Bandaging Trial: Evidence-informed leg ulcer care and the effectiveness of two compression technologies. | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21995267 et al. | 2011">[156]</a> is a large RCT with low risk of bias. Ultimately, authors of this study agreed that: there is at least moderate-quality evidence that compression is superior to no compression and should be the mainstay of treatment for venous ulcers of the lower extremities, that multicomponent systems are superior to single component systems, and that an elastic component is needed <a href="/app/reference?id=1544" class="reference" title="Comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of compression modalities for the promotion of venous ulcer healing and reducing ulcer recurrence. | Mauck, Karen F et al. | 2017">[88]</a>.</li>

These findings are based on low quality evidence due to the small number of studies and patients included, and their poor methodological quality. Authors mentioned that the very few&nbsp;RCTs&nbsp;evaluating PRP are underpowered to detect treatment effects, if they exist, and are generally at high or unclear&nbsp;risk&nbsp;of&nbsp;bias&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=65" class="reference" title="Autologous platelet-rich plasma for treating chronic wounds. | Martinez-Zapata, Maria José et al. | 2017">[111]</a></li>

                    <li>A few recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of PRGF or epidermal growth factors (EGF) as local treatment for venous ulcers. One small trial with 58 patients compared application of PRGF and standard care and found that the average percentage healed area of the PRGF group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p=0.001). However, the trial was small and at unclear risk of bias&nbsp;<a href="/app/reference?id=1205" class="reference" title="Efficacy and safety of the use of platelet-rich plasma to manage venous ulcers. | Escamilla Cardeñosa, Manuel et al. | 2017">[108]</a> .

                    <li>In 2014, Barrientos et al published a review on growth factors for chronic wounds and concluded that the four growth factors that have shown the greatest potential in randomized controlled trials include GM-CSF, PDGF, bFGF and VEGF. Current studies to date are small, and have disparate endpoints and modes of growth factor and cytokine administration. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to support efficacy, side effect profiles, and long term outcomes. All data should be interpreted with caution and any off-label use of these products for the management of wounds should be used in conjunction with the standard of care for non-healing wounds. Areas for future study include optimal delivery methods for growth factors and use of different combinations of growth factors and other adjuvant therapies in addition to debridement <a href="/app/reference?id=1133" class="reference" title="Clinical application of growth factors and cytokines in wound healing. | Barrientos, Stephan et al. | 2017">[107]</a>.</li>

A randomized prospective study. | Warburg FE, Danielsen L, Madsen SM, Raaschou HO, Munkvad S, Jensen R, et al. | 1994">[163]</a>. In Warburg 1994, both groups had vein surgery and authors found no evidence of a significant benefit for autografts over a dressing in this small trial (102 participants) (risk ratio (RR) of healing with autografts 0.89, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 2.31). Jankunas 2007 reported a large difference in healing rates (RR of healing 42.93, 95% CI 2.72 to 677.16). Authors of the meta-analysis concluded that these trials provide no firm evidence of benefit rather than firm evidence of lack of benefit. The different results could be due to the fact that at baseline, the Warburg 1994 trial had larger ulcers in the skin graft group, which may have biased the results against grafting, or it may indicate that allocation was subverted as there was no indication whether allocation was concealed <a href="/app/reference?id=1431" class="reference" title="Skin grafting for venous leg ulcers. | Jones, June E et al. | 2017">[115]</a></p>

                  <p>A 2013 Cochrane systematic review analyzed 2 trials (71 participants) that compared a single-layered dermal replacement (Krishnamoorthy 2003; Omar 2004) with standard care of four-layer compression and a low-adherent dressing. Both trials evaluated Dermagraft (Smith and Nephew), described as a human fibroblast-derived dermal replacement; the origin of the cells being newborn foreskin. There was no evidence of benefit associated with dermal skin replacement (at baseline) compared with standard care. There is therefore insufficient evidence, based on 2 small studies, that single-layered dermal skin replacement heals venous ulcers more quickly than a simple low-adherent dressing <a href="/app/reference?id=1431" class="reference" title="Skin grafting for venous leg ulcers. | Jones, June E et al. | 2017">[115]</a>.</p>

Five of these trials investigated Micronised Purified Flavonoid Fraction (MPFF), and 4 evaluated hydroxyethylrutosides (HR). Meta-analyses showed that more venous leg ulcers were healed in the MPFF groups than in the control groups (RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74), and in the HR groups than in the control groups (RR 1.70; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.34). However, most of these trials were poorly reported, and so had an unclear risk of bias for randomization, allocation concealment, blinding and methods for addressing incomplete outcome data.

Meta-analysis of three RCTs suggests an increase in the proportion of ulcers completely healed with sulodexide as an adjuvant to local treatment compared with local treatment alone (rate of complete healing with sulodexide 49.4% compared with 29.8% with local treatment alone; RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.12). This evidence for sulodexide increasing the rate of complete healing is of low quality due to risk of bias (evidence level C).

Results demonstrated that early healing (at ≤5 months) in patients with venous stasis and diabetic foot ulcers was favorably influenced by both high- and low-intensity ultrasound delivered at a low frequency—either via contact or noncontact techniques. However, the quality of the data may be suspect, especially for low-frequency low-intensity noncontact ultrasound because of significant biases. In patients presenting with either venous stasis or diabetic foot ulcers (Wagner classification 1-3), early healing appears to be facilitated by either low-frequency low-intensity noncontact ultrasound or low-frequency high-intensity contact ultrasound.</p>

The study found that the median time to healing in the NPWT group was 28 days (95% CI 25.5 to 32.5) compared with 45 days (95% CI 36.2 to 53.8) in the standard care group. The study reported an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.2, 95% CI 1.7 to 6.2 suggesting a higher chance of healing with NPWT. However, this evidence was considered of low quality due to imprecision and indirectness. Authors of the review concluded that there is no RCT evidence on the effectiveness of NPWT as a primary treatment for leg ulcers, and that there is limited evidence regarding the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for the treatment of hard-to-heal leg ulcers.
